## Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is the crucial first step in any NLP pipeline, involving cleaning and preparing raw text data for analysis or modeling.

### Key Components:

**Text Cleaning**
- Removing special characters, HTML tags, and unwanted symbols
- Handling encoding issues and character normalization
- Dealing with noise in text data

**Case Normalization**
- Converting text to lowercase for consistency
- Preserving case when it carries semantic meaning (proper nouns, acronyms)

**Handling Whitespace**
- Normalizing spaces, tabs, and newlines
- Removing extra whitespace while preserving text structure

**Punctuation Treatment**
- Removing or standardizing punctuation marks
- Considering punctuation's role in sentence boundaries and meaning

### Example Pipeline:
```python
import re
import string

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Remove HTML tags
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)
    
    # Remove special characters but keep spaces
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '', text)
    
    # Normalize whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    
    return text
```

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens. These tokens serve as the basic building blocks for further NLP processing.

### Types of Tokenization:

**Word-Level Tokenization**
- Splits text into individual words
- Simple but struggles with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
- Good for languages with clear word boundaries

**Subword Tokenization**
- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): Iteratively merges most frequent character pairs
- WordPiece: Similar to BPE but uses likelihood-based merging
- SentencePiece: Language-agnostic subword tokenization

**Character-Level Tokenization**
- Treats each character as a token
- No OOV problem but loses word-level semantics
- Useful for character-level tasks or morphologically rich languages

### Modern Approaches:

**BERT Tokenization (WordPiece)**
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("Natural language processing")
# Output: ['natural', 'language', 'processing']

# Handling unknown words
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
# Output: ['super', '##cal', '##if', '##rag', '##ili', '##stic', '##ex', '##pi', '##ali', '##doc', '##ious']
```

## Text Representation

Converting text into numerical representations that machine learning models can process is fundamental to NLP.

### Traditional Approaches:

**Bag of Words (BoW)**
- Represents text as a collection of word frequencies
- Ignores word order and grammar
- Simple but effective for many classification tasks

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Weights words by their frequency in a document relative to their frequency across all documents
- Helps identify important words specific to a document
- Formula: `TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) × log(N/DF(t))`

**N-grams**
- Captures local word order by considering sequences of n words
- Unigrams (1-gram), bigrams (2-gram), trigrams (3-gram)
- Balances simplicity with some contextual information

### Modern Dense Representations:

**Word Embeddings**
- Dense vector representations of words
- Capture semantic relationships between words
- Examples: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText

**Contextual Embeddings**
- Word representations that change based on context
- Same word can have different vectors in different sentences
- Examples: ELMo, BERT, GPT embeddings

## Language Models

Language models predict the probability of word sequences, forming the foundation for many NLP applications.

### Types of Language Models:

**N-gram Models**
- Predict next word based on previous n-1 words
- Markov assumption: future depends only on limited history
- Simple but limited by data sparsity

**Neural Language Models**
- Use neural networks to model word sequences
- Can capture longer dependencies
- Better generalization than n-gram models

**Autoregressive Models**
- Generate text one token at a time
- Condition on previously generated tokens
- Examples: GPT series, traditional RNNs

**Masked Language Models**
- Predict masked tokens using bidirectional context
- Can see both left and right context
- Examples: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT

**Autoencoder Models**
- Encode input into latent representation, then decode
- Good for understanding and representation learning
- Examples: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

## Embeddings

Embeddings are dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning and relationships between linguistic units.

### Word Embeddings:

**Word2Vec**
- Skip-gram: Predict context words from target word
- CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words): Predict target word from context
- Captures semantic and syntactic relationships

**GloVe (Global Vectors)**
- Combines global statistical information with local context
- Factorizes word co-occurrence matrix
- Often performs well on word analogy tasks

**FastText**
- Extends Word2Vec to subword level
- Handles out-of-vocabulary words
- Especially good for morphologically rich languages

### Sentence and Document Embeddings:

**Doc2Vec**
- Extension of Word2Vec to documents
- Learns fixed-size representations for variable-length documents

**Universal Sentence Encoder**
- Pre-trained model for sentence-level embeddings
- Good for semantic similarity tasks

**BERT Embeddings**
- Contextual embeddings from transformer models
- Can be pooled or averaged for sentence representations

## Attention Mechanisms

Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions, addressing limitations of fixed-size representations.

### Key Concepts:

**Attention Weights**
- Normalized scores indicating relevance of each input position
- Sum to 1 across all positions
- Computed using query, key, and value vectors

**Self-Attention**
- Input elements attend to other elements in the same sequence
- Allows modeling of long-range dependencies
- Foundation of transformer architecture

**Multi-Head Attention**
- Parallel attention mechanisms with different learned projections
- Allows model to attend to different types of information
- Provides richer representations

### Attention Formula:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

Where:
- Q: Query matrix
- K: Key matrix  
- V: Value matrix
- d_k: Dimension of key vectors

## Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture has revolutionized NLP by providing a powerful, parallelizable framework for sequence modeling.

### Core Components:

**Encoder-Decoder Structure**
- Encoder: Processes input sequence into representations
- Decoder: Generates output sequence from encoded representations
- Not all models use both (BERT: encoder-only, GPT: decoder-only)

**Position Encoding**
- Adds positional information to input embeddings
- Sinusoidal encoding or learned positional embeddings
- Necessary because attention is permutation-invariant

**Layer Normalization**
- Normalizes inputs to each layer
- Stabilizes training and improves convergence
- Applied before or after attention/feed-forward layers

**Feed-Forward Networks**
- Point-wise fully connected layers
- Typically has expansion and contraction:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[d_model] --> B[d_ff]
    B --> C[d_model]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ffecb3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    
    subgraph FFN["Feed-Forward Network"]
        D[Expansion → Processing → Contraction]
    end
```

- Adds non-linearity and processing capacity

**Residual Connections**
- Skip connections around attention and feed-forward layers
- Helps with gradient flow in deep networks
- Combined with layer normalization

### Popular Transformer Models:

- Balances both metrics
- Formula: `2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

### Language Modeling Metrics:

**Perplexity**
- Measures how well a model predicts a text
- Lower perplexity indicates better performance
- Formula: `exp(-1/N × Σ log P(w_i))`

**BLEU Score**
