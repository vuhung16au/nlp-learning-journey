## What are Large Language Models?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are artificial intelligence systems that have been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models represent the current state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing and have revolutionized how we interact with AI systems.

### Definition and Scope

LLMs are neural networks, typically based on the **Transformer architecture**, that contain billions or even trillions of parameters. They are trained using **self-supervised learning** on enormous datasets containing text from books, articles, websites, and other written sources to learn patterns, relationships, and structures in human language.

### Key Characteristics

- **Scale**: Contains millions to trillions of parameters
- **Generalization**: Can perform multiple NLP tasks without task-specific training
- **Few-shot Learning**: Can learn new tasks from just a few examples
- **Emergent Abilities**: Display capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed
- **Multimodal**: Advanced models can process text, images, and other data types

## Why Learn NLP Before LLMs?

Understanding Natural Language Processing fundamentals is absolutely essential before working with Large Language Models. Here's why this learning progression is crucial:

### 1. **Foundation Understanding**
