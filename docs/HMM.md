## Introduction to Hidden Markov Models

**Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** are statistical models that represent systems which are assumed to be Markov processes with unobservable (hidden) states. In the context of Natural Language Processing, HMMs model the relationship between observable sequences (like words or phonemes) and hidden sequences (like part-of-speech tags or phonological states).

### Core Concept

An HMM assumes that:
- There is an underlying system with hidden states that evolve over time
- We can only observe outputs that are probabilistically related to these hidden states
- The hidden states follow a Markov property: the current state depends only on the previous state
- The observations are conditionally independent given the hidden states

### Why HMMs Matter in NLP

HMMs were revolutionary in NLP because they provided:

- **Statistical Framework**: A principled way to handle uncertainty in language
- **Sequential Modeling**: Ability to model dependencies in sequences of words
- **Supervised Learning**: Could be trained on labeled data for specific tasks
- **Interpretability**: Clear probabilistic interpretation of model decisions
- **Efficiency**: Computationally tractable algorithms for inference and learning

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic Notation

Let's define the mathematical components of an HMM:

- **States**: $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$ - Set of hidden states
- **Observations**: $O = \{o_1, o_2, ..., o_m\}$ - Set of possible observations
- **State Sequence**: $Q = q_1, q_2, ..., q_t$ - Sequence of hidden states
- **Observation Sequence**: $X = x_1, x_2, ..., x_t$ - Sequence of observations

### Model Parameters ($\lambda$)

An HMM is completely specified by three sets of parameters:

#### 1. Initial State Probabilities ($\pi$)
$$ \pi = \{\pi_i\} \text{ where } \pi_i = P(q_1 = s_i) $$
The probability that the model starts in state $s_i$.

#### 2. Transition Probabilities (A)
$$ A = \{a_{ij}\} \text{ where } a_{ij} = P(q_{t+1} = s_j | q_t = s_i) $$
The probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.

#### 3. Emission Probabilities (B)
$$ B = \{b_i(o_k)\} \text{ where } b_i(o_k) = P(x_t = o_k | q_t = s_i) $$
The probability of observing $o_k$ when in state $s_i$.

### Mathematical Properties

#### Markov Assumption
$$ P(q_{t+1} | q_1, q_2, ..., q_t) = P(q_{t+1} | q_t) $$

#### Output Independence Assumption
$$ P(x_t | q_1, q_2, ..., q_t, x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1}) = P(x_t | q_t) $$

#### Joint Probability
The probability of observing a sequence X and state sequence Q is:
$$ P(X, Q | \lambda) = \pi(q_1) \times \prod_{i=1}^{T-1} a(q_i, q_{i+1}) \times \prod_{i=1}^{T} b(q_i, x_i) $$

## Key Components and Architecture

### State Space Design

The choice of hidden states depends on the specific NLP task:

**Part-of-Speech Tagging**:
- States: {Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Determiner, ...}
- Observations: {words in vocabulary}

**Speech Recognition**:
- States: {phoneme states, silence states}
- Observations: {acoustic features}

**Named Entity Recognition**:
- States: {Person, Location, Organization, Other}
- Observations: {words and their features}

### Transition Structure

Different transition structures serve different purposes:

**Linear Chain HMM**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[s₁] --> B[s₂]
    B --> C[s₃]
    C --> D[...]
    D --> E[sₙ]
    
    style A fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
```
Used for sequential labeling where order matters.

**Fully Connected HMM**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[s₁] --> B[s₂]
    A --> C[s₃]
    A --> D[sₙ]
    B --> A
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --> A
    C --> B
    C --> D
    D --> A
    D --> B
    D --> C
    
    style A fill:#582C67,stroke:#C60C30,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#582C67,stroke:#C60C30,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#582C67,stroke:#C60C30,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#582C67,stroke:#C60C30,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
```
Maximum flexibility but requires more parameters - every state can transition to every other state.

**Ergodic HMM**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[s₁] --> B[s₂]
    A --> C[s₃]
    B --> C
    B --> A
    C --> A
    C --> B
    
    style A fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    
    subgraph Notes
        sub1[Every state is reachable<br/>from every other state]
    end
    
    style sub1 fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:1px
```
Ensures model convergence and stability - every state is reachable from every other state.

## The Three Fundamental Problems

### Problem 1: Likelihood (Evaluation)

**Given**: Model $\lambda = (A, B, \pi)$ and observation sequence X
**Find**: $P(X | \lambda)$

**Solution**: Forward Algorithm

The forward algorithm computes the probability of observing the sequence up to time t and being in state i at time t.

Forward variable:
$$ \alpha_t(i) = P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_t, q_t = s_i | \lambda) $$

Initialization:
$$ \alpha_1(i) = \pi_i \times b_i(x_1) $$

Recursion:
$$ \alpha_{t+1}(j) = \left[ \sum_i \alpha_t(i) \times a_{ij} \right] \times b_j(x_{t+1}) $$

Termination:
$$ P(X | \lambda) = \sum_i \alpha_T(i) $$

### Problem 2: Decoding (Finding Most Likely State Sequence)

**Given**: Model $\lambda$ and observation sequence X
**Find**: Most likely state sequence $Q^*$

**Solution**: Viterbi Algorithm

The Viterbi algorithm finds the most probable state sequence using dynamic programming.

Viterbi variable:
$$ \delta_t(i) = \max P(q_1, q_2, ..., q_{t-1}, q_t = s_i, x_1, x_2, ..., x_t | \lambda) $$

Initialization:
$$ \delta_1(i) = \pi_i \times b_i(x_1) $$

Recursion:
$$ \delta_{t+1}(j) = \max[\delta_t(i) \times a_{ij}] \times b_j(x_{t+1}) $$

Path tracking:
$$ \psi_{t+1}(j) = \arg\max[\delta_t(i) \times a_{ij}] $$

### Problem 3: Learning (Parameter Estimation)

**Given**: Observation sequence X
**Find**: Model parameters $\lambda^*$ that maximize $P(X | \lambda)$

**Solution**: Baum-Welch Algorithm (Forward-Backward)

This is an instance of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

#### E-Step: Compute Expected Values

**Forward variables**: $\alpha_t(i)$ (as defined above)

**Backward variables**: 
$$ \beta_t(i) = P(x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, ..., x_T | q_t = s_i, \lambda) $$

Initialization:
$$ \beta_T(i) = 1 $$

Recursion:
$$ \beta_t(i) = \sum_j a_{ij} \times b_j(x_{t+1}) \times \beta_{t+1}(j) $$

**State probabilities**:
$$ \gamma_t(i) = P(q_t = s_i | X, \lambda) = \frac{\alpha_t(i) \times \beta_t(i)}{P(X | \lambda)} $$

**Transition probabilities**:
$$ \xi_t(i,j) = P(q_t = s_i, q_{t+1} = s_j | X, \lambda) = \frac{\alpha_t(i) \times a_{ij} \times b_j(x_{t+1}) \times \beta_{t+1}(j)}{P(X | \lambda)} $$

#### M-Step: Update Parameters

$$ \hat{\pi}_i = \gamma_1(i) $$

$$ \hat{a}_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \xi_t(i,j)}{\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \gamma_t(i)} $$

$$ \hat{b}_i(v_k) = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} \gamma_t(i) \times I(x_t = v_k)}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} \gamma_t(i)} $$

where $I(x_t = v_k)$ is an indicator function.

## Applications in NLP

### 1. Part-of-Speech Tagging

HMMs were among the first successful statistical approaches to POS tagging.

**Model Setup**:
- **Hidden States**: POS tags (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)
- **Observations**: Words in the sentence
- **Task**: Given a sentence, find the most likely sequence of POS tags

**Example**:
```
Sentence: "The cat sits on the mat"
States:   DET  N   V    P  DET  N
```

**Advantages**:
- Captures sequential dependencies between tags
- Handles unknown words through emission probabilities
- Provides probabilistic confidence in predictions

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

HMMs can identify and classify named entities in text.

**Model Setup**:
- **Hidden States**: Entity types (Person, Location, Organization, Other)
- **Observations**: Words and their features
- **Task**: Identify entity boundaries and types

**BIO Tagging Scheme**:
```
Sentence: "John works at Google in California"
Tags:     B-PER O    O  B-ORG O  B-LOC
```

### 3. Speech Recognition

One of the most successful early applications of HMMs.

**Model Setup**:
- **Hidden States**: Phoneme states or sub-phoneme states
- **Observations**: Acoustic feature vectors (MFCC, spectrograms)
- **Task**: Convert acoustic signals to text

**Architecture**:
```
Acoustic Model: HMM for each phoneme
Language Model: N-gram model for word sequences
Pronunciation Model: Maps words to phoneme sequences
```

### 4. Machine Translation (Historical)

Early statistical machine translation systems used HMMs for alignment.

**Model Setup**:
- **Hidden States**: Alignment positions in target language
- **Observations**: Words in source language
- **Task**: Find optimal word alignments between languages

### 5. Information Extraction

HMMs can extract structured information from unstructured text.

**Applications**:
- Date/time extraction
- Address parsing
- Email signature extraction
- Biomedical entity extraction
