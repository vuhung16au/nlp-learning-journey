## What is GPT?

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** is a family of large language models developed by OpenAI that uses the transformer architecture to generate human-like text. GPT models are **autoregressive language models** that predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding context.

### Core Definition

GPT is fundamentally a **decoder-only transformer architecture** trained to predict the next token in a sequence through **unsupervised learning** on vast amounts of text data. This simple yet powerful approach enables GPT to:

- Generate coherent, contextually relevant text
- Understand and respond to prompts
- Perform various NLP tasks without explicit training
- Exhibit emergent capabilities through scale

### Key Characteristics

- **Autoregressive Generation**: Predicts one token at a time, left-to-right
- **Transformer-Based**: Built on the attention mechanism
- **Pre-trained**: Trained on large corpora before fine-tuning
- **Generative**: Primarily designed for text generation tasks
- **Few-shot Learning**: Can perform tasks with minimal examples

## Architecture and Technical Foundation

### Transformer Decoder Architecture

GPT uses only the **decoder portion** of the original transformer architecture, modified for causal (left-to-right) language modeling.

        sub2[Feed-Forward Networks]
        sub3[Residual Connections]
        sub4[Layer Normalization]
    end
```

### Core Components

**1. Causal Self-Attention**

GPT uses **masked self-attention** to ensure that predictions for position $i$ can only depend on positions less than $i$:

$$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T + M}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V $$

Where:
- $Q$ is the query matrix
- $K$ is the key matrix  
- $V$ is the value matrix
- $M$ is a causal mask that sets future positions to negative infinity
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors

**2. Multi-Head Attention**

Multiple attention heads allow the model to attend to different types of relationships:

$$ \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O $$

Where:
- $\text{head}_i$ represents the $i$-th attention head
- $h$ is the number of attention heads
- $W^O$ is the output projection matrix
- $\text{Concat}$ concatenates the outputs from all heads

**3. Feed-Forward Networks**

Position-wise feed-forward networks process each position independently:

$$ \text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2 $$

Where:
- $x$ is the input vector
- $W_1$ and $W_2$ are weight matrices
- $b_1$ and $b_2$ are bias vectors
- $\max(0, \cdot)$ is the ReLU activation function

**4. Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**

Each component includes residual connections and layer normalization for stable training:

$$ \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{Sublayer}(x)) $$

Where:
- $x$ is the input to the sublayer
- $\text{Sublayer}(x)$ represents either the attention or feed-forward sublayer
- The addition $x + \text{Sublayer}(x)$ implements the residual connection
- $\text{LayerNorm}$ normalizes the combined output

## How GPT Works

### Autoregressive Generation Process

GPT generates text through an autoregressive process where each token is predicted based on all previous tokens in the sequence.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input: "The cat"] --> B[Predict: "sat"]
    B --> C[Input: "The cat sat"] --> D[Predict: "on"]
    D --> E[Input: "The cat sat on"] --> F[Predict: "the"]
    F --> G[Input: "The cat sat on the"] --> H[Predict: "mat"]

    style A fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#582C67,color:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#C60C30,stroke:#582C67,color:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:2px
```

### Training Objective

GPT is trained using **next-token prediction** with cross-entropy loss:

$$ L = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1}) $$

Where $P(w_i | w_1, ..., w_{i-1})$ is the probability of the $i$-th token given all previous tokens.

### Inference Process

During inference, GPT uses various **decoding strategies**:

**1. Greedy Decoding**: Select the most probable token at each step
**2. Beam Search**: Maintain multiple candidate sequences
**3. Top-k Sampling**: Sample from the k most probable tokens
**4. Nucleus (Top-p) Sampling**: Sample from tokens with cumulative probability p

## GPT's Relevance to NLP

### Revolutionary Impact on NLP

GPT has fundamentally transformed Natural Language Processing in several key ways:

**1. Paradigm Shift from Task-Specific to General-Purpose Models**

Traditional NLP required separate models for each task:
```
Sentiment Analysis Model + NER Model + QA Model + Translation Model
```

GPT provides a unified approach:
```
Single GPT Model â†’ Multiple NLP Tasks
```

**2. From Supervised to Unsupervised Learning**

- **Before GPT**: Heavy reliance on labeled datasets
- **With GPT**: Self-supervised learning on raw text enables powerful capabilities

**3. From Rule-Based to Learning-Based Systems**

GPT learns language patterns implicitly rather than through explicit programming of linguistic rules.

### Core NLP Capabilities

def preprocess_training_data(raw_text):
    """
    Preprocess text data for GPT training
    """
    # Tokenization
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(raw_text)
    
    # Sequence chunking
    sequences = chunk_sequences(tokens, max_length=context_length)
    
    # Data cleaning and filtering
    clean_sequences = filter_and_clean(sequences)
    
    return clean_sequences
```

**2. Training Objective**

The model learns to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the training data:

$$ \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(w_t^{(i)} | w_{<t}^{(i)}) $$

Where $N$ is the number of sequences and $T$ is the sequence length.

- Improving instruction following
- Task-specific optimization

**2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
