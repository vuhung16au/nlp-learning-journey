    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Document Summarization**: Combine multiple related documents into one summary\n",
    "2. **Query-Focused Summarization**: Create summaries focused on specific questions or topics\n",
    "3. **Timeline Summarization**: Summarize events in chronological order\n",
    "4. **Sentiment-Aware Summarization**: Include sentiment information in summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extractive vs Abstractive**: Extractive selects existing sentences, abstractive generates new text\n",
    "- **Multiple approaches**: Frequency-based, TF-IDF, TextRank, and transformer models each have strengths\n",
    "- **Quality vs Speed**: Transformer models provide better quality but are slower\n",
    "- **Domain matters**: Different types of text may need different summarization approaches\n",
    "- **Evaluation is challenging**: Automatic metrics don't always capture human perception of quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose appropriate method**: Consider your quality requirements and computational constraints\n",
    "2. **Preprocess carefully**: Clean text and handle special formatting\n",
    "3. **Set reasonable length targets**: Too short loses information, too long defeats the purpose\n",
    "4. **Evaluate on your domain**: Generic models may not work well for specialized text\n",
    "5. **Consider user needs**: Different users may need different types of summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **News aggregation**: Create brief summaries of news articles\n",
    "- **Document management**: Summarize long reports and documents\n",
    "- **Email processing**: Generate brief summaries of email threads\n",
    "- **Research assistance**: Summarize academic papers and research\n",
    "- **Content curation**: Create digests of content for different audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about multi-document summarization techniques\n",
    "- Explore query-focused and topic-specific summarization\n",
    "- Study evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR\n",
    "- Practice with domain-specific documents\n",
    "- Experiment with fine-tuning transformer models\n",
